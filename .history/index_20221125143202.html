        <h1 class="header">About Me</h1>
        <p class="description">I am currently a student at the University of Central Florida working towards a degree in Computer Science. My coursework of Concepts in Computer Science, and Intro to Programming with C have provided me with fundamental programming skills in the languages C and Python. While I worked at Chick-Fil-A for three years, starting in High School, as a Team Member, I was able to gain experience working in customer service and dealing with difficult requests from guests. Tutoring for Tutor Doctor required me to teach and explain concepts in various classes to struggling students. My internship at The Office of Senator Marco Rubio involved assisting constituents of the State of Florida with federal casework that could be detrimental to the livelihood of the constituent and their family. At the University of Central Florida I am an active member of both KnightHacks and the Association for Computing Machinery in which I partake in workshops, hackathons, and team projects. I am proficient in the programming languages Javascript, Python, C, HTML/CSS, and C#. The frameworks I have used are Unity Engine and React.</p>
