        <h1 class="header">About Me</h1>
        <p class="description">I am currently a student at the University of Central Florida working towards a degree in Computer Science. My coursework of Concepts in Computer Science, and Intro to Programming with C have provided me with fundamental programming skills in the languages C and Python. While I worked at Chick-Fil-A for three years, starting in High School, as a Team Member, I was able to gain experience working in customer service and dealing with difficult requests from guests. Tutoring for Tutor Doctor required me to teach and explain concepts in various classes to struggling students. My internship at The Office of Senator Marco Rubio involved assisting constituents of the State of Florida with federal casework that could be detrimental to the livelihood of the constituent and their family. At the University of Central Florida I am an active member of both KnightHacks and the Association for Computing Machinery in which I partake in workshops, hackathons, and team projects. I am proficient in the programming languages Javascript, Python, C, HTML/CSS, and C#. The frameworks I have used are Unity Engine and React.</p>
        <h2 class="header">Progress</h2>
        <p class="description">My Digital Portfolio is coming along really well, I have decided to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build my webpage because it is what I am more comfortable building web pages with. I am very happy with my page layout; I developed a sleek navbar with a hamburger menu that displays the menu options with animation to make my webpage feel more interactive and easy to navigate through. I am not too happy about the color scheme I chose, I thought that using typical dark mode colors would make the page appear more professional but I think it might be too dull. I plan on experimenting with some lighter color schemes that are more interesting. The fonts are clear and easy to read with an appropriate color choice. I used a font generator to find google fonts that would pair well with each other while having some contrast. Through the process of creating this digital portfolio I gave myself a lot of time to try learning the Bootstrap CSS framework. This involved a lot of YouTube videos and reading through the Bootstrap documentation. While I learned a lot about Bootstrap I felt like it was limiting my creativity by only using their components and styling. </p>
